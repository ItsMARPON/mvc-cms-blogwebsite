# Model View Controller (MVC) Tech Blog [License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

I want to build a Tech Blog website similar to Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. The app will follow theMVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
